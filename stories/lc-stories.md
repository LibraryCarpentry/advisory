### How has Library Carpentry helped you?
Data savvy training helped me learn what coding and data cleanup tools were out there, and what they were used for. 
Even in the instances where I didn't immediately (or ever) use the tool, I have experience with it and know what it 
does and can recommend that tool to someone who needs what it does. It has also given me the basic data/coding language 
that I need in order to effectively collaborate with researchers and data scientists.

### Green Sticky
The training inspired me to become a certified Carpentry instructor. I never, ever thought I'd want to teach, but 
I've discovered that I really love it, and am intrigued by the challenges inherent in developing good, effective lessons.

### Red Sticky
Library Carpentry needs to expand its current teaching materials/lessons. There is a critical need for a library-based 
Python lesson, and one on scripting - what it is, why and when we use it, what languages are used to script.
