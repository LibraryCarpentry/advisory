- New lessons on research data <https://github.com/librarycarpentry/lc-research-data>, digital pres <https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/lc-dig-pres>
- The new website was also a focus and is near release. There were 230+ commits to that website repo.
- Chris Erdmann and Belinda Weaver wrote a [blog post about the sprint](http://librarycarpentry.org/blog/2018/05/16/our-latest-sprint/).

2) Handling responses from the engagement form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uqXtEN6WKU_lO6lOFuwX7Mt1WzkFy--3flbj3NciMGI/edit#responses)

We have had 55 inquiries about Library Carpentry through the form.
Chris is working through the list and contacting people. 

3) Motions regarding future engagement / merger with The Carpentries (in order for us to have some official standing regarding representation on the Carpentries website and elsewhere - on their side, The Carpentries' Exec Council members are considering a motion)
Greg Wilson moved: 
I move that Library Carpentry conduct merger discussions with the Carpentries
Tim seconded and the motion was carried unopposed on call. 

4) Onboarding instructors to teach Library Carpentry (i.e. what we do at our CarpentryCon workshop)

* Discussion on the merits of a blended instructor training vs designated training for Librarians - think we like both depending on audience (academic or public)
* Part of the IMLS grant stipulates two instructor trainings
   * We supported one in-person and one online training for these instructor trainings 

5) Report from Chris Erdmann now he has started as Library Carpentry Community Dev person
