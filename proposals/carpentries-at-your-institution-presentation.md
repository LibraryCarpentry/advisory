## Carpentries at Your Institution Proposal

### Identifying Researchers’ Needs 
* Growing need to automate research processes for speed and reproducibility
* Rsearchers/labs have little money to hire programmers or informatics specialists (or they identify the need late)
* Little to no training in graduate curriculum for computing skills

### About The Carpentries
* Offers intensive, two-day workshops on command line tools, programming languages, and version control
* Lesson materials are freely reusable under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.
* Over 1500 certified instructors, 1300 workshops, 37,000 learners in 44 countries

### Hosting a Workshop
* 2 full days from 9:00AM to 4:30PM
* 2 instructors and multiple helpers
* Typically, 40 learners or less per workshop
* Leverage network of Carpentries instructors to host multiple workshops per year
* Discipline/role specific lessons
 
### Workshop Example Schedule

Day One  
* 9:00 – 12:00 Automating task with the Unix Shell

* 1:00-4:00 Building Program with Python
* 4:15-4:30 Wrap Up  

Day Two   
* 9:00 – 12:00 Version Control with Git and GitHub

Some Testimonials from University of Oklahoma
* “Thank you. I can now figure out where to begin with python, shell, and github, and can learn it by myself, not afraid of it.”
* “This workshop should be mandatory for every RA at OU. Useful, very useful!”

* Carpentries will find instructors, handle registration, support instructor logistics, and coordinate/share assessment results 
with the member organization
* A designated contact approves coordinated workshop requests for that organization 
* Instructor travel expenses are the responsibility of the member and are not covered in membership fees

For Self-organized Workshops:
* Organization is responsible for finding local instructors and handling the logistics of the workshop coordination 
* It can be labeled as a Carpentry workshop if at least one instructor is certified and Carpentries content is taught
