Digital technology is fundamentally altering academic and research libraries. The rapid pace of change has left a gap 
in the skill set of library staff. Library Carpentry was founded to fill this gap by nurturing the new skills 
and competencies required for the operation of a 21st century research library.  It is a growing community of 
instructors and lesson developers whose mission is to teach librarians the tools, techniques and best practices 
to: work with data, automate repetitive tasks, support world-class research, and deliver data-savvy, team-based 
services to the academic and wider community.

Using the pedagogical practices of live coding, pair programming, discussion and exercises, Library Carpentry 
creates a safe and collaborative space for important concepts in computing and data, including data manipulation 
and organization, text and data mining, and workflow versioning and management. Not only do these skills help librarians 
create reproducible workflows and reliable operations for data-centric tasks, they give librarians a common language 
with researchers that can lead to a better mutual understanding of data issues and it paves the way to greater 
collaboration between the library and their research community. 

Since 2015, Library Carpentry has held close to sixty workshops worldwide and three global sprints involving 
hundreds of contributors to improve the lesson materials. A recent Institute of Museum and Library Services 
grant ([RE-85-17-0121-17](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/re-85-17-0121-17)) has led to the creation of a 
Library Carpentry Community and Development Director position to help grow the community, instructors, and 
lesson materials further. Library Carpentry is able to leverage the overall Carpentries operations infrastructure 
and community which includes thousands of instructors around the world. The director is working with libraries 
to on-board more instructors and create a richer network for libraries to develop data savvy, team-based services 
that expand to meet data needs of organizations and networks. 

Librarians who have attended workshops have reported improved abilities in automating curation workflows, communicating 
more effectively with researchers, collaborating on projects, and generating reports more efficiently, to name a few. 
Library Carpentry offers a lightweight opportunity to provide ongoing professional development to library teams and 
low-cost pathways for organizations or networks to get started.

An effort is being made by the [LIR HEAnet Group](https://lirgroup.heanet.ie/) to establish Library Carpentry in 
Ireland. LIR have run one workshop covering  *Data intro for Librarians* and the *Unix Shell* in Waterford and plan 
to repeat that event in Dublin during Summer 2018. Additional lessons from the 
[Library Carpentry portfolio](https://librarycarpentry.org/#portfolio) will be offered in 2019. The main challenges 
to continued growth of the network in Ireland will be raising awareness, interest and participation for both 
instructors and attendees.
