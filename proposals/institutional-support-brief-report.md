## Brief Report to Support Carpentries in the Libraries

### Recommendation:

We recommend the Libraries partner with the (e.g. Research Office, Graduate School, IT) to become partners in The Carpentries. 
The Carpentries workshops teach basic research computing skills specifically targeted towards scientists, humanists, and 
librarians. Partner organizations receive annual access to instructor training and are able to run low-cost local workshops 
while developing communities of practice around effective data-driven reproducible research.  

The Carpentries offer excellent extensions on the collaborative, up-skilling efforts in the Libraries and our strategic 
efforts around research support, open science, and the digital humanities.  There are also added benefits of scale in using 
training material that has been collaboratively developed by a global community of experts together with the ability to 
invite instructors from The Carpentries network.

Our institution partners are interested in a (e.g. Silver Tier Software Carpentry membership, $7,500 for one year):

* Benefits compared to (e.g. Bronze Tier, the lowest tier): 
** Local institutional cohort of (e.g. 6) instructors trained online 
** Greater access to The Carpentries infrastructure support and participation in community advisory groups

### Resource Implications:

The Libraries will pursue a collaborative cost sharing agreement with the (e.g. Research Office, Graduate School, IT), 
reducing the cost to the Libraries to (e.g. USD, EUR, JPY). The following staff from the Libraries will participate in 
the program...

Carpentry training focuses on pedagogy and assumes familiarity with the content being taught. It includes curriculum 
that is accessible to a number of audiences. Participants are able to choose a particular technology from a suite of options 
(e.g. Python) upon completion. There is a training commitment of roughly 20 hours. Following the training, instructors 
are encouraged to run and participate in courses (potentially at other institutions nearby). For the first year of membership, 
our recommendation is to teach/host (e.g. 2 workshops) following the certification of the instructor trainees. At the conclusion 
of the first year, a report/presentation/meeting will be held to share feedback, evaluate the program, and determine the 
institution's next steps.

Membership at the (e.g. Silver Tier) level also includes taking a greater role in The Carpentries. The commitment includes 
monitoring and participating in discussion threads, attending monthly online meetings (e.g. 1-2 hours/month), and if 
necessary, in person annual meetings.

### Value Proposition:

Engage in strategic partnerships.  
Relatively low-cost opportunity to partner with (e.g. Research Office, Graduate School, IT) to advance the Libraries role 
in enhancing research and supporting data science intiatives (on campus).

Enhance (e.g. faculty and student) success.  
The Libraries seeks to sponsor workshops, competitive programs, and shared activities that create opportunities for 
(e.g. students and faculty) in all disciplines to develop and demonstrate their skills in research, software development, 
digital scholarship, digital humanities, making, data science and visualization. The Carpentries are a natural extension 
of this goal as it is already a workshop-based program which encourages the development of skills related to research 
computing. Additionally, The Carpentries complements existing Libraries programming (e.g. open science, data visualization).

Invest strategically in research infrastructure.  
Since The Carpentries draw upon volunteer instructors for their workshops, often from campus, local communities, or nearby 
regions, the Libraries may leverage its research support staff and work with this community of expert volunteers to develop a 
new model of research collaboration with its institutional partners. Library staff can leverage expertise related to 
data science and analytics, visualization, the integration of digital tools into teaching and research, bibliometric analysis, 
and text-mining, and are well positioned to provide instruction in these areas to the institution. Not only does The 
Carpentries supplement the skills library staff have, it can provide an established pedagogical format, a well known brand 
for attracting attendees, and the opportunity for librarian instructors to facilitate workshops beyond the Libraries. A 
partnership with The Carpentries presents opportunities for further collaboration with the (e.g. other units at the 
institution) as these workshops develop the computing skills of scientists, engineers, digital humanists, and researchers.

Foster interdisciplinarity.  
There have already been (e.g. number of workshops) held at the institution including... Further Carpentries workshops 
can build on the popularity and success of the previous workshops, Libraries programs, and spaces. These workshops can 
provide an additional vehicle for engagement and outreach to (e.g. faculty and students) at the institution.
