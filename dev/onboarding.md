## Onboarding instructors

#### Onboarding existing certified instructors

The following issues need to be addressed:

- Different demographic

Librarians have different motivations for attending than researchers at SWC/DC workshops who are generally trying to solve research problems

- Dual outcomes

Workshops aim to help librarians 1) improve their own work practices 2) teach skills to others, e.g. colleagues, researchers, students

- Resistance

This becomes an issue when people are 'drafted' by their management to attend rather than attending of their own volitio.
There is a need to discuss strategies for overcoming resistance and reluctance of some attendees, for 
convincing them they can master the material, and so on

- Library roles

We need to provide general background for instructors on the different types of libraries, and the different roles 

- Strong need to demonstrate practical applications for the skills

Librarians are very keen to discuss how will they use and apply the skills learned.

- Need for workarounds for people who have no laptop/no ability to install software

- Need for handouts and cheat sheets - much more inportant than in SWC and DC workshops
