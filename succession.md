## Onboarding

- Review [Roles and Responsibilities]()
- New members encouraged to watch at least one LC lesson and consider joining the Maintainer team for that lesson, which provides context from lesson development (e.g. new or under development)
- Help new members connect with all communication channels, TopicBox (LC Advisory Group, Libraries), Slack (#libraries), Twitter, GitHub Governance repository, LC Advisory Group Etherpad, Google community calendar
- Review Etherpad of previous LC Advisory Group meeting agendas/notes
- Review Governance repo, review closed issues (from combined meeting), decide if issues should be reopened, new issues should be created, or abandoned
- Bring issues/new ideas to prioritizing meeting, where members vote on the top 5-7 items to address in the next 1-2 years
- Joint blog post with outgoing members, new members provide brief summary of where they are coming from, why they want to be a part of the Advisory Group, and what they might want to work on moving forward.

## Offboarding
- Help with recruiting (replacements)
- Identify leads on projects/issues opened 
- By default close/sunset projects/issues, provide description/outcomes, present closed to issues to new members who can then reopen, create new issues, or abandon
- Be present at least a combined meeting where outgoing members can explain context of projects/issues to incoming members; identify at least one responsible person that will be available for follow up question
- Joint blog post of welcoming new members, outgoing members, co-chairs responsible for spearheading blog post, individuals should provide summaries of what they did/would like to do (what interested them in joining). Outgoing members thanked for their service.
- Add past members to Advisory Group page (page structure will need be developed)
- Words of wisdom/lessons learned during combined/handover meeting (captured in Etherpad notes, each member contributes a point or two)
- Chairs check in with each member to confirm who is leaving and who is continuing - need a yes for folks to continue (for those who may have fallen off)
