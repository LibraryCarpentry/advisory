# Growing Library Services w/ The Carpentries  
## ZB Med - Cologne - Information Center for Life Science  

* Previous institutions dating back to 1908 (Bibliothek der Akademie fur praktische Medizin)
* Founded in 1973 as German National Library of Medicine - Deutsche Zentralbibliothek fur Medizin (ZB MED)
* Since 2001 additional location in Bonn besides the headquarter in Cologne
* Covers the broad spectrum of life sciences including medicine, biology, agriculture, nutritional sciences
* Around 120 employees
* Total budget of 12M

## Konrad Foerstner  

* Studied biochemistry and computer science (University of Greifswald)
* PhD in Bioinformatics (EMBL Heidelberg)
* Freelancing software developer
* Postdoc then head of the Core Unity Systems Biology in University of Wurzburg
* Since May 2018 joint professor of information literacy at TH Koln - University of Applied Sciences and Head of Information Services at ZB MED

## Carpentries Experience
* Certified Software Carpentry (SWC) instructor since May 5, 2015
* Instructor of 11 SWC and 3 Library Carpentry (LC) workshops

## Current State

_The good news:_  
Open Access is on its way to becoming the default publishing mode.

_Science Europe: cOAlition S / Plan S_  
https://www.coalition-s.org/

_This doesn’t mean that research libraries are not needed anymore._  
Research libraries have new tasks.

_The mission remains the same:_  
Scientific libraries must preserve research output and provide access to it.

_Libraries should become major publishers (again) and drivers of open access._
Help scientific communities to flip their journals to open access or start new open access journals following the FAIR Open Access Principles.  
https://www.fairopenaccess.org/

_PUBLISSO is the open access publication portal for the life sciences._  
https://www.publisso.de/

_Open science is the only way we should do science_

_(From Konrad's experience) first hand experience with regard to the pressures on scientists for depositing, curating their data_  
Many tasks librarians can help with (licensing, curation, etc)  
Also with regard to discovery, integration of tools

_Not trivial!_  
Numerous different file formats, licenses, privacy issues, legal requirements, provenance and interaction between different items…

_Ultimately, access creates new problems:_
Increased effort to find and process information.

Libraries must provide skills training and build tools to find, connect, and integrate, literature, information, and data to create new knowledge.

## We are facing a huge skills gap.

_Shifting to Data Savvy: The Future of Data Science in Libraries_  
http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/33891/1/Shifting%20to%20Data%20Savvy.pdf

_TH Koln - Data and Information Science (Bachelor's program)_  
https://www.th-koeln.de/en/academics/data-and-information-science-bachelors-program_53882.php  
Currently under construction at ZBIW of the TH Koln:  
Certificate course - Data Librarian  
Integration of Library Carpentry in training program / certificate course  
https://librarycarpentry.org/

_Offer everybody at ZB MED_  
One workshop per month (3 so far)
Lessons: Unix Shell, Python, Git, and then more Python
Workshops are in German
Currently internal only but will be opened up
Two additional instructors joining (Silvia Di Giorgio and Till Sauerwein)
Silvia Di Giorgio taking a lead role in organizing workshops

## Feedback:
* Overall experience has been good
* Bridge to current work missing
* Exercises needed
* Jupyter Notebook Examples (https://github.com/konrad/Bits_and_pieces_for_the_carpentries_workshops/tree/master/python)
* Participants of previous workshops are already helping with new workshops

## How do we continue after Carpentry workshops?
* Peer-to-peer mentoring
* ~1 hour long
* 1 topic presented, then open discussion, Q&A, hacking on common challenges
* Organized by Eva Seidlmayer

## Developing new lessons
* Extend and improve Git, Python
* Start new lessons such as Wikidata, ORC
* Eva Seidlmayer, Konrad Foerstner, Muhammad Elhossary, Till Sauerwein

_Exciting News! Library Carpentry now a Carpentries Lesson Program._

## Moving forward… 
* Also provide Software & Data Carpentry workshops in addition to Library Carpentry workshops
* Provide workshops in English
